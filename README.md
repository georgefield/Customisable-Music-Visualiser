# Customisable Music Visualiser
3rd year Discrete Maths dissertation project.

Aim to have a music visualiser with lots of customisation options and inbuilt signal processing to allow the user to visualise the fourier transform, tempo, note onset, and structure of a sound file in real time while it plays.

Currently working on signal processing.

Aim to have a finished program in time for the live project demonstration (around 13th march)
